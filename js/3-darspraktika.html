                In this chapter, we discuss how HTML documents are represented on a computer and over the Internet.

                The section on the document character set addresses the issue of what abstract characters may be part of
                an HTML document. Characters include the Latin letter "A", the Cyrillic letter "I", the Chinese
                character meaning "water", etc.

                The section on character encodings addresses the issue of how those characters may be represented in a
                file or when transferred over the Internet. As some character encodings cannot directly represent all
                characters an author may want to include in a document, HTML offers other mechanisms, called character
                references, for referring to any character.

                Since there are a great number of characters throughout human languages, and a great variety of ways to
                represent those characters, proper care must be taken so that documents may be understood by user agents
                around the world.
            </p>
            <section id="the-Document-Character-Set">
                <h2 style="color: blue">5.1 The Document Character Set</h2>
                <p>
                    To promote interoperability, SGML requires that each application (including HTML) specify its
                    <i>document character </i>set. A document character set consists of:


                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A Repertoire: A set of abstract characters,, such as the Latin letter "A", the Cyrillic letter
                        "I",
                        the Chinese character meaning "water", etc.
                    </li>
                    <li><i>Code positions</i>: A set of integer references to characters in the repertoire</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Each SGML document (including each HTML document) is a sequence of characters from the repertoire.
                    Computer systems identify each character by its code position; for example, in the ASCII character
                    set, code positions 65, 66, and 67 refer to the characters 'A', 'B', and 'C', respectively.

                    The ASCII character set is not sufficient for a global information system such as the Web, so HTML
                    uses the much more complete character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS), defined in
                    [ISO10646]. This standard defines a repertoire of thousands of characters used by communities all
                    over the world.

                    The character set defined in [ISO10646] is character-by-character equivalent to Unicode ([UNICODE]).
                    Both of these standards are updated from time to time with new characters, and the amendments should
                    be consulted at the respective Web sites. In the current specification, "[ISO10646]" is used to
                    refer to the document character set while "[UNICODE]" is reserved for references to the Unicode
                    bidirectional text algorithm.

                    The document character set, however, does not suffice to allow user agents to correctly interpret
                    HTML documents as they are typically exchanged -- encoded as a sequence of bytes in a file or during
                    a network transmission. User agents must also know the specific character encoding that was used to
                    transform the document character stream into a byte stream.
            </section>

            <section id="character-encodings">
                </p>
                <h2 style="color: blue">5.2 Character encodings</h2>
                <p>
                    What this specification calls a character encoding is known by different names in other
                    specifications (which may cause some confusion). However, the concept is largely the same across the
                    Internet. Also, protocol headers, attributes, and parameters referring to character encodings share
                    the same name -- "charset" -- and use the same values from the [IANA] registry (see [CHARSETS] for a
                    complete list).

                    The "charset" parameter identifies a character encoding, which is a method of converting a sequence
                    of bytes into a sequence of characters. This conversion fits naturally with the scheme of Web
                    activity: servers send HTML documents to user agents as a stream of bytes; user agents interpret
                    them as a sequence of characters. The conversion method can range from simple one-to-one
                    correspondence to complex switching schemes or algorithms.

                    A simple one-byte-per-character encoding technique is not sufficient for text strings over a
                    character repertoire as large as [ISO10646]. There are several different encodings of parts of
                    [ISO10646] in addition to encodings of the entire character set (such as UCS-4).

                <h3 style="color: blue">5.2.1 Choosing an encoding</h3>
                <p>Authoring tools (e.g., text editors) may encode HTML documents in the character encoding of their
                    choice, and the choice largely depends on the conventions used by the system software. These tools
                    may employ any convenient encoding that covers most of the characters contained in the document,
                    provided the encoding is correctly labeled. Occasional characters that fall outside this encoding
                    may still be represented by character references. These always refer to the document character set,
                    not the character encoding.

                    Servers and proxies may change a character encoding (called transcoding) on the fly to meet the
                    requests of user agents (see section 14.2 of [RFC2616], the "Accept-Charset" HTTP request header).
                    Servers and proxies do not have to serve a document in a character encoding that covers the entire
                    document character set.

                    Commonly used character encodings on the Web include ISO-8859-1 (also referred to as "Latin-1";
                    usable for most Western European languages), ISO-8859-5 (which supports Cyrillic), SHIFT_JIS (a
                    Japanese encoding), EUC-JP (another Japanese encoding), and UTF-8 (an encoding of ISO 10646 using a
                    different number of bytes for different characters). Names for character encodings are
                    case-insensitive, so that for example "SHIFT_JIS", "Shift_JIS", and "shift_jis" are equivalent.

                    This specification does not mandate which character encodings a user agent must support.

                    Conforming user agents must correctly map to ISO 10646 all characters in any character encodings
                    that they recognize (or they must behave as if they did).
                </p>

                <p><b>Notes on specific encodings </b></p>
                <p>
                    When HTML text is transmitted in UTF-16 (charset=UTF-16), text data should be transmitted in network
                    byte order ("big-endian", high-order byte first) in accordance with [ISO10646], Section 6.3 and
                    <span style="color: red">[UNICODE]</span>, clause C3, page 3-1.

                    Furthermore, to maximize chances of proper interpretation, it is recommended that documents
                    transmitted as UTF-16 always begin with a ZERO-WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE character (hexadecimal FEFF,
                    also called Byte Order Mark <span style="color: red">(BOM))</span> which, when byte-reversed,
                    becomes hexadecimal FFFE, a character guaranteed never to be assigned. Thus, a user-agent receiving
                    a hexadecimal FFFE as the first bytes of a text would know that bytes have to be reversed for the
                    remainder of the text.

                    The UTF-1 transformation format of <span style="color: red">[ISO10646] </span>(registered by IANA as
                    ISO-10646-UTF-1), should not be used. For information about ISO 8859-8 and the bidirectional
                    algorithm, please consult the section on bidirectionality and character encoding.

                <h2 style="color: blue">5.2.2 Specifying the character encoding</h2>
                <p>
                    How does a server determine which character encoding applies for a document it serves? Some servers
                    examine the first few bytes of the document, or check against a database of known files and
                    encodings. Many modern servers give Web masters more control over charset configuration than old
                    servers do. Web masters should use these mechanisms to send out a "charset" parameter whenever
                    possible, but should take care not to identify a document with the wrong "charset" parameter value.

                    How does a user agent know which character encoding has been used? The server should provide this
                    information. The most straightforward way for a server to inform the user agent about the character
                    encoding of the document is to use the "charset" parameter of the "<span
                        style="color: blue">Content-Type</span>" header field of the HTTP protocol <span
                        style="color: red">([RFC2616],</span> sections 3.4 and 14.17) For example, the following HTTP
                    header announces that the character encoding is EUC-JP:


                </p>
                <code style="color: red">Content-Type: text/html; charset=EUC-JP</code>
                <p>
                    Please consult the section <span style="color: blue"><u>conformance</u></span> for the definition of
                    <span style="color: blue"><u>text/html.</u></span>

                    The HTTP protocol <u><span style="color: red">([RFC2616], </span></u>section 3.7.1) mentions
                    ISO-8859-1 as a default character encoding when the "charset" parameter is absent from the
                    "Content-Type" header field. In practice, this recommendation has proved useless because some
                    servers don't allow a "charset" parameter to be sent, and others may not be configured to send the
                    parameter. Therefore, user agents must not assume any default value for the "charset" parameter.

                    To address server or configuration limitations, HTML documents may include explicit information
                    about the document's character encoding; the META element can be used to provide user agents with
                    this information.

                    For example, to specify that the character encoding of the current document is "EUC-JP", a document
                    should include the following<span style="color: red"><u>META</u></span> declaration:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <span style="color: red"><u>META</u></span> declaration must only be used when the character
                    encoding is organized such that ASCII-valued bytes stand for ASCII characters (at least until the
                    META element is parsed). META declarations should appear as early as possible in the HEAD element.

                    For cases where neither the HTTP protocol nor the <span style="color: red"><u>META</u></span>
                    element provides information about the character encoding of a document, HTML also provides the
                    charset attribute on several elements. By combining these mechanisms, an author can greatly improve
                    the chances that, when the user retrieves a resource, the user agent will recognize the character
                    encoding.

                    To sum up, conforming user agents must observe the following priorities when determining a
                    document's character encoding (from highest priority to lowest):


                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        An HTTP "charset" parameter in a "Content-Type" field
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A META declaration with "http-equiv" set to "Content-Type" and a value set for "charset".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <small style="color: blue"><u>charset </u></small> set on an element that designates an
                        external resource.

                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    In addition to this list of priorities, the user agent may use heuristics and user settings. For
                    example, many user agents use a heuristic to distinguish the various encodings used for Japanese
                    text. Also, user agents typically have a user-definable, local default character encoding which they
                    apply in the absence of other indicators.

                    User agents may provide a mechanism that allows users to override incorrect "charset" information.
                    However, if a user agent offers such a mechanism, it should only offer it for browsing and not for
                    editing, to avoid the creation of Web pages marked with an incorrect "charset" parameter.

                <p>
                    A given character encoding may not be able to express all characters of the document character set.
                    For such encodings, or when hardware or software configurations do not allow users to input some
                    document characters directly, authors may use SGML character references. Character references are a
                    character encoding-independent mechanism for entering any character from the document character set.

                    Character references in HTML may appear in two forms:
                </p>
                <ul>
